        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
            <cite><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search' class='text-dark'>Depth First Search(DFS)</a></cite> Algorithm is a searching algorithm in graph theory
            where we are given a graph <i>G(V,E)</i> where <i>V</i> is the set of vertices(nodes) and <i>E</i> is the set of Edges connecting vertices, we are given with a start node
            and the node that we need to find in the graph i.e. the goal node. now the algorithm proceeds as follows.
        </p>
        <code>
        <ol>
            <li>make all nodes unvisited</li>
            <li>push the first node onto the stack</li>
            <li>while the stack is not empty do</li>
            <li> &emsp;pop the first element from stack let it be v</li>
            <li> &emsp;if v is the goal node then return</li>
            <li> &emsp;make v as visited</li>
            <li> &emsp;push all nodes adjacent to v which are not visited on to the stack</li>
        </ol>
        </code>
        <p>
            Here is also a recursive implementation of the Algorithm which must be called by start node as the initial parameter.
            this one is more efficien and mostly used implementation of DFS.assume initally all nodes were unvisited.
        </p>
        <code>
            <b>Procedure DFS(node n)</b>
        <ol>
            <li>if n is goal node then return</li>
            <li>make n as visited node</li>
            <li>for each node i adjacent to n</li>
            <li> &emsp;if i is not visited then</li>
            <li> &emsp;DFS(i)</li>
        </ol>
        </code>
        <p>
            The way Algorithm proceeds will not make any loops in the path followed by the algorithm, by this strategy
            we will get a tree from the paths followed by the DFS algorithm.
        </p>

        <h2>Maze Generation</h2>
        <p>
            In our implementation we will have to traverse the whole graph starting from a random node and adding the edges that the
            Algorithm follows during the traversal of graph, which will give us the tree that we want and this will ultimately be the maze we wanted.
            also the choice of the vertext that the algorithm explores next in the algorithm step 3 of Procedure DFS will be taken random which will give us the complete maze.

        <h2>Explaination</h2>
        <p>
            Lets take the following scenerio with 28 nodes and are coonected by the links as shown in the figure.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src='../../../images/maze/dfs/1.png' class="img-responsive">
        </div>
        <p>
            Now let the algorithm start form node 11, making 11 as visited, now adjacent non visited nodes are 4,12,10 and 18, now suppose algorithm
            chooses randomly node 4 as next node.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src='../../../images/maze/dfs/2.png' class="img-responsive">
        </div>
        <p>
            Now we are at node 4, the algorithm make 4 as visited. now adjacent non visited nodes are 5 and 3 now suppose algorithm
            chooses randomly node 5 as next node.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src='../../../images/maze/dfs/3.png' class="img-responsive">
        </div>
        <p>
            Now we are at node 5, the algorithm make 5 as visited. now adjacent non visited nodes are 6 and 12 now suppose algorithm
            chooses randomly node 12 as next node.
        </p>
        <div>
            <img src='../../../images/maze/dfs/4.png' class="img-responsive">
        </div>
        <p>
            After Sufficient Iterations the scenerio will look like this.
