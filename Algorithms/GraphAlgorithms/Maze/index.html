        <h1>Maze Generation</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Maze generation is one of my most favouraite programs and the first one when I started learning graphics in my college.
            this is an interesting topic and also helps you understand the working of basic Graph Algorithms and how to generate maze from those.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Remember those puzzels you must had seen in your comics when you were in 1st grade, where there was a figure in which you have to figure out a path from the start to the destination.
            Well how about our computer generate those maze like puzzels. you can do this by using simple graph algorithms.
            This page explains the basic components you need to know about generating basic mazes after which you can proceed to exploring the
            specific algorithms used for generating mazes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically this page will tell you about three algorithms used for basic maze generation and the corresponding interactive graphics are present on the
            corresponding pages.

        <h2>How to generate a Maze ?</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, A maze is collection of paths typically from source to destination.
            to generate a maze we first need a collection of points(vertices or nodes) which will be connected randomly by lines(or walls)
            so we first need to generate a collection of nodes. the nodes should be positioned in the fashion as shown below.
            all the points are finite distance apart and distance between two adjacent node are constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now to generate a maze we only have to join some points with other and left some gaps and joints. In the further sections we will explain different algorithms
            for generating trees which will apper like maze in the graphics window.
